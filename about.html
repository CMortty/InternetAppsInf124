    <h2>Our Origin</h2>
    <p>We began as a printing company in 1415. Created by a man by the name of Gutenberg.
    He later tried to sell his invention to every household in germany. It wasn't long before he realized that the printers were too large and cumbersome
    to fit into people's homes. In 1976 we took his printer and transformed it into a masterpiece with the ability to fit on any consumer desk. Today we have used that
    technology to display images and text directly onto electronic devices without the need to transpose the likeness of those images onto paper.
    We believe we can enhance every single life in Siberia by sharing our electronics with the world. Together we will bring the world MORE ELECTRONICS!
